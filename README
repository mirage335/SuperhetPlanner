SuperhetPlanner enables radio designers to predict complex harmonic-generated image responses and birdies.

__Usage__
Straightforward. Enter RF frequencies to tune in, the LO Type (conversion architecture), IF frequency, and preselection filter passband. Also set the IF filter passband in the Upper-Selection columns.

Image responses and birdies, including those generated by harmonics, will be shaded red. Also, consider setting a wide IF filter passband (Upper Selection) to see birdies approaching the IF frequency.

Consider repeating the process for multi-stage radios.

Note the superiority of the "RF+IF" upconversion architecture. Consider however, the resulting 5kHz instability from using a 50ppm oscillator at 100MHz.
